## Customization
1. Register a `GitHub` account;
2. Fork a copy of this repo to your own `GitHub` account;
3. Customize `./font/content.json` in your forked repo online by the [eLuvLetter JSON Generator](https://www.modelscope.cn/studios/Genius-Society/eluvletter);
4. Commit the modification to your forked repo.

## Deployment on Netlify
1. Enter [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com) official website;
2. Use your GitHub account to login by authorization, click `Add new site` - `Import an existing project`;
3. Click `GitHub`, enter the keyword `eLuvLetter` in the search box to find the previously forked repo, and select it;
4. Click `Deploy site` to jump into `Site overview` page automatically, click `Site settings`;
5. Click `Change site name` under `Site information`, modify second-level domain name not conflict to others, and click `Save`;
6. After the deployment, we can visit `https://%PROJECT_NAME%.netlify.app` to broswe your page, where `%PROJECT_NAME%` is the second-level domain name customized by you.

**Good luck~💖**
